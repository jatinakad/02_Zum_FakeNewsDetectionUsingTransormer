## Project Objective
Detect fake news and real news by using various type of news data in english language.The objective of the project is to detect fake news with the help of BERT transformer for NLP.

## Project Description
Fake news detection is an important task in the age of misinformation, as it can help prevent the spread of false or misleading information. One approach to detecting fake news is to use a natural language processing (NLP) model such as the BERT transformer.
The BERT transformer is a deep learning model that has been trained on a large dataset of natural language text. It has the ability to understand the context and meaning of words in a sentence, which makes it well-suited for tasks such as fake news detection.
This can be done by feeding the BERT transformer the text of the article and the corresponding label (real or fake). The transformer will learn to associate certain words or phrases with fake news, and will be able to make predictions based on this information.
Once the classifier is trained, you can use it to classify new, unseen articles as either real or fake. You can also use the classifier to identify certain characteristics or patterns that are commonly associated with fake news, which can help in the development of strategies for detecting and combating fake news.

Overall, the use of the BERT transformer for fake news detection can be an effective way to identify and prevent the spread of false or misleading information.
